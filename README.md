# [SF-Environment-Benchmark](http://smoningi.github.io/SF-Environment-Benchmark/Prototype%20Visualization/)
Set of applications to visualize SF building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

The original goal of the SF Environment Benchmark project was to visualize building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to encourage owners and building managers to make proper changes. In addition we would like to analyze the data available to see if we can predict what energy consumption or emissions will be like in the future. We've currently developed a prototype web application that visualizes the data in an interactive format. In addition, we'll be meeting with the SF Department of Environment, who are the stewards of the data, to see what their needs and requirements are. We can cater the project to their needs and requirements to make sure to solve problems at hand.
